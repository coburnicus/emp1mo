          <p>Effective job coaching strives to maximize employee independence and to promote stability at work. Job performance is only part of what leads to employment success. Equally essential is that the new employee fits in and is included in a meaningful way as a member of that workplace culture. So, what are natural supports, really? And exactly what can you do you to help make social inclusion happen? This session will discuss concrete strategies to engage coworkers and supervisors while taking full advantage of workplace activities to enhance social inclusion.</p>

        <p>Self-determination means making choices and decisions based on our preferences and interests, monitoring and regulating our actions, and being goal-oriented and self-directed. These behaviors contribute to positive outcomes for students and young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities (ID/DD) as they transition from school to adult life.</p>
          <p>In this training, we’ll discuss the impact of self-determination on outcomes for people with disabilities and share a self determined career development model. We’ll also cover ways that schools, state agencies, and providers can collaborate to promote self-determination through a person-driven transition process.</p>
