          <p>When looking for a new job, most of us “do the math.”  We consider what we need (food, housing, healthcare) and what we want (a gym membership, a car, a vacation). Then we evaluate whether a particular job will help us achieve our goals.  So why do our conversations about employment for people with disabilities start with protecting Social Security benefits? </p>

              <p>Benefits can be a lifeline, but continuous reliance on them can limit people to a life in poverty. Join this webinar to learn more about how you can reframe the conversion and help people you support and their families to consider their options in a new way.  </p>
