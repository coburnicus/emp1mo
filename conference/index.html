            <p><em>David Hoff, Institute for Community Inclusion/UMass Boston</em></p>
            
            <p>Gaining work experience is critically important to long-term job and career success. It is important that formative work experiences for both youth and adults utilize the principles of work-based learning. This session will examine the critical factors in effective work-based learning, including the use of an interactive approach that fully engages the individual and business, using experiences that are reflective of the individual&rsquo;s interests and career path status and the wide range of labor market needs, and how learning is incorporated within these experiences in a structured way.

He will discuss his vision for a more focused effort on creating opportunities for people across the disability spectrum &ndash; not just for those with autism spectrum disorder, nor only for those who are less impacted. People with disabilities have a wide range of interests and abilities, and it is important that the opportunities available to them reflect that diversity.</p>

            <p>Any good job search begins by reflecting on past experiences, marketable skills and work preferences.&nbsp; From there, you begin to update your resume and start exploring your possibilities.&nbsp; The process is no different for people you support.&nbsp; Your assistance in helping them find a job should start by assessing their work goals, their current abilities, and their interests.&nbsp; This presentation will focus on how to implement person-centered planning, identify personal and family networks, and develop vocational profiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;We will discuss how to use discovery to learn more about the job seeker and to job start the job search process. &nbsp;</p>
