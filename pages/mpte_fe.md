One of the 4 focus areas of MPTE is consistent parental and family support for competitive integrated employment. Early and ongoing expectations and support from an individual’s family is critically important for employment and career success. 

To accomplish this, MPTE is working to ensure that families have clear and consistent information regarding best practices in employment; that families know how to make the most of the transition process to prepare their family member for career success; and that families are aware of how to use and manage the resources available to support access to competitive integrated employment, both while the individual is in school, and after they leave school.

<p>Families want what is best for their youth or young adult with a disability. This includes the opportunity to be a part of the community and earn income through employment. Some families may be apprehensive to explore competitive employment, especially if their son or daughter has high support needs. Others may see a future that includes employment, but don’t know how to support their son or daughter in preparing for it. This session will highlight the importance of family involvement in the employment success of youth, while providing strategies for professionals to better engage families in the process. Topics will include understanding the family perspective, addressing apprehension in exploring community-based employment, and strategies for helping families play a key role in career readiness and the job search.
